# Slug Test Analysis

Python scripts for the plotting and analysis of rising-head slugtests.

## For users
This repository includes python scripts for the plotting and analysis of rising head slugtests. K values are calculated with the Bouwer & Rice (1976) method modified for anisotropy by Zlotnik (1994) and the Hvorslev (1951) method. The guidelines of Butler (1997) are used for the selection of normalized heads: normalized heads in the range of 0.20-0.30 for Bouwer and Rice (1976) and 0.15-0.25 for Hvorslev (1951).
